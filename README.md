🎹 MIDI Chord Explorer

MIDI ChChord Explorer lets you play notes from a MIDI keyboard (or your computer keys) and instantly see what chord you’ve created. It suggests missing notes, voice-leading steps, scale context, and musical directions you can explore.

Partial Chords Explained: If you are missing tones, it shows what to add.

Scale Context: Shows which scales fit the chord and lists their notes.

Bookmarking: Save chords you like using the ⭐ star icon.

No MIDI Keyboard? Use Computer Keys

You can play using your keyboard. Examples:

…and so on.

(This allows everyone to explore chords even without hardware!)

🧠 Understanding the Chord Card
Where Next

Shows musical pathways that make sense from the current chord
(e.g., V → I, ii → V, IV → I, etc).

Voice Leading

Explains how notes move to the next chord:

keep → notes that stay the same

drop → notes that stop sounding

add → new notes you introduce

This helps make smooth, professional chord progressions.

Scale Context

Lists scales that fit the chord, so improvising and melody writing become easy.
