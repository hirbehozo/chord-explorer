# chord-explorer
MIDI Chord Explorer lets you play notes on an usb midi enabled synth (or computer keys) and instantly see the chord you're creating. It suggests ways to complete chords, shows next chord options with voice-leading guidance, and highlights compatible scales. Bookmark chords, copy details, and explore harmony interactively and visually.
